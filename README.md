# Offline AI Assistant – Project Blueprint

This archive contains a structured blueprint for building a fully offline,
user‑controlled AI assistant similar in experience to earlier ChatGPT versions.

Core principles:

- 100% offline operation by default
- User‑initiated sync only (no background networking)
- Hybrid models (desktop larger, mobile smaller)
- Rawlsian ethics engine (veil‑of‑ignorance fairness)
- Capability‑based data governance
- Full user autonomy over data access and policy

See individual docs for architecture, ethics framework, build roadmap,
and secure knowledge‑pack distribution.
